# Morley Labs

**Bridging Industrial Automation and Cardano**

Morley Labs is developing an open-source framework for integrating industrial automation with the Cardano blockchain. The work here began with Ladder Logic, the dominant programming language for PLCs, but we aim to expand support for additional industry standard formats. By bringing automation logic on-chain, we enable verifiable, decentralized, and tamper resistant execution of industrial processes.

## Repositories

### [Morley-Core](https://github.com/Morley-Labs/Morley-Core)
Library for Intermediate Representation (IR) between industrial automation languages and Cardano. This repository contains mappings, tests, and the full compiler pipeline for converting Ladder Logic and other automation languages into Plutus smart contracts.

### [Documentation](https://github.com/Morley-Labs/Documentation)
Comprehensive documentation for the Morley ecosystem, including setup guides, component usage, and architecture references.

### [ArkWriter](https://github.com/Morley-Labs/ArkWriter)
A web-based development environment for creating and deploying Ladder Logic-based smart contracts using Morley.

### [Educational-Resources](https://github.com/Morley-Labs/Educational-Resources)
A repository dedicated to learning Ladder Logic, providing guides, examples, and tutorials for industry professionals and developers.

### [GitHub Configuration](https://github.com/Morley-Labs/.github)
Houses organization level configurations, templates, and workflow automation for Morley-Labs.
